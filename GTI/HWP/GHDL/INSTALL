ghdl-0.31-mcode-win32 Installation Instructions

-----------------------------
Installation:

 - Create a ghdl directory where desired, e.g. C:\ghdl  

 - Unzip ghdl-0.31-mcode-win32.zip into C:\ghdl

 - Open a command shell and cd into the resulting installation directory, C:\ghdl\ghdl-0.31-mcode-win32

 - Run these batch files:
    set_ghdl_path.bat 
    reanalyze_libraries.bat

 - Check the installation (see below)

-----------------------------
Command Prompt PATH setup

GHDL is a command line tool.

For each new command shell opened, run set_ghdl_path.bat to configure the PATH and GHDL library prefix.


You can instead set PATH and GHDL_PREFIX in the Windows SYSTEM or USER environment variables; see the comments in set_ghdl_path.bat for more information.


-----------------------------
To Uninstall:

 - delete the installation directory, e.g. C:\ghdl\ghdl-0.31-mcode-win32 

 Also, if you have manually set the GHDL environment variables for PATH and GHDL_PREFIX, remove these changes.

-----------------------------
Installation check

Once GHDL is set up, issuing the following commands should print the version and configuration information shown below (line breaks added for clarity):


    C:\Ghdl\ghdl-0.31-mcode-win32>ghdl -v
